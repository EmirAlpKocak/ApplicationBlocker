<p>When you launch Application Blocker for the first time, the program will ask you if you want to upgrade your settings. If you have upgraded Application Blocker to a new version, your settings should be upgraded as well to avoid losing the list of blocked applications. Click "Yes" to upgrade your settings. If you have installed Application Blocker for the first time, you can click "No" to continue.<p>
